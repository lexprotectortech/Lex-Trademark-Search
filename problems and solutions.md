# **Summary of Problems and Solutions**

---

## **1. CORS Errors:**

**Problem**:  

- When trying to make an API request from the frontend, you faced Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors because the browser blocked requests from different domains for security reasons.

**Solution**:  

- **Backend Solution**: You created a backend server to handle CORS by adding the `cors` middleware. This allowed you to fetch data from the external API on the backend, and then the frontend could safely interact with your backend, bypassing the CORS issue.
- You also set up a custom proxy in your `client` folder, ensuring frontend requests were routed through your backend.

---

## **2. Fetching API Data on the Frontend:**

**Problem**:  

- You were trying to fetch API data on the frontend, but without backend support, CORS errors were preventing the request.

**Solution**:  

- Implemented a backend server that fetched data from the external API.
- The backend made the API request and passed the results to the frontend, which resolved the issue.

---

## **3. Handling API Response and State Updates:**

**Problem**:  

- There were issues when fetching data and updating the React state, such as API response handling, and you couldn't properly display the results.

**Solution**:  

- You added state management (`useState`) for the API results, total results, and loading states.
- The API data was properly processed and set into state, allowing for dynamic rendering of the search results.

## **4. Displaying Long Text in the Table (CSS and Layout Issues):**

**Problem**:  

- The long text in table cells was breaking the layout of your table, causing the page to scroll sidewise or become misaligned.
- The table content overflowed due to long text in the "Trademark", "Classes", "Countries", and "Status" columns.

**Solution**:  

- You added truncation logic to limit text to 8-10 words (using `truncateText`), ensuring that long text values did not overflow.
- You increased padding and adjusted the layout to make the table more spacious and readable.
- You applied CSS adjustments (like using `overflow-x-auto` and proper padding) to improve the alignment and appearance.

## **5. Table Layout and Overflow:**

**Problem**:  

- When text was too long, the table columns didn't align properly, and some data overflowed, making the content hard to read.

**Solution**:  

- You ensured text truncation and added padding to improve the readability and alignment of the table content.
- Added `overflow-x-auto` to the parent container to allow horizontal scrolling if the content overflows, but without affecting the overall table structure.

---

## **6. Debugging Fetch Logic and Console Output:**

**Problem**:  

- You couldn't get any output in the console during the fetch operation.

**Solution**:  

- You added logging inside the `fetchData` function to check the flow and the API response at different stages (e.g., before and after fetching the data).
- Ensured proper handling of API response status and errors using `try-catch`.

---

## **7. Testing and Final Adjustments:**

**Problem**:  

- The application still had issues with the table layout after some fixes were applied.

**Solution**:  

- Tweaked padding and column widths for better alignment and readability.
- Made sure that both header (`th`) and data (`td`) elements were aligned and consistently spaced.

### **Key Points in the Solution:**

1. **Backend for CORS**: You set up a Node.js backend server using Express to handle API requests and bypass the CORS issue.
2. **State Management**: You used React's state management (`useState`) to handle data from the API and to track loading and result statuses.
3. **Text Truncation**: Implemented text truncation logic to limit long strings to a manageable number of characters, preventing layout issues.
4. **Table Layout**: Improved the table layout with consistent padding and responsive handling of overflow.
5. **Debugging**: Added logging to check the flow of data and ensure the fetch operation worked correctly.

### **Conclusion:**

By addressing CORS issues, implementing a backend proxy, handling API data properly, and improving the frontend layout, you resolved the major problems you faced. The application now works smoothly with a responsive table and accurate data fetching from the backend.
